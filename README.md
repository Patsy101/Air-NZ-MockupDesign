Hello and welcome to my Air New Zealand redesign project!

My name is Patrick Tricenio and I am passionate about the Air New Zealand brand. Having first come to know the airline in 2014, I have been consistently impressed with their commitment to innovation, customer experience, and the promotion of New Zealand's unique culture and identity.

With this project, I set out to redesign various elements of Air New Zealand's branding and user interface, with the goal of better reflecting the company's values and enhancing the customer experience.

Included in this repository are various mockups and designs that I have created, including new logos, website layouts, and promotional materials. Each of these designs is intended to showcase the unique qualities of the Air New Zealand brand, such as their commitment to sustainability and the promotion of indigenous culture.

Throughout the design process, I have paid close attention to the needs and preferences of Air New Zealand's target audience. By considering the needs of customers and employees, I believe that these designs can help to enhance the overall user experience and promote greater engagement with the brand.

I hope that these designs are of interest to you and that they provide a fresh perspective on the Air New Zealand brand. Please feel free to browse the repository and provide any feedback or suggestions that you may have.
