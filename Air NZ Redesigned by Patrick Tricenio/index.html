When things do not start well, you wonder what kind of trip you are in for when you haven't flown with the airline before.  However, I must say...WOW...it was a great experience from the time we boarded in Hawaii to the arrival (and departure) in Auckland.  The onboard staff was extremely friendly, funny and willing to help with anything.  If they do not genuinely care about you, then they do a really good job of acting like it.

                        <p class = "text">Overall enjoyed flying on Air New Zealand. For our short flight from Auckland to Queenstown they came and offered beverages and snacks. One thing I do not like about this airline is how much they charge if you want to make an adjustment to your flight. Talk about nickel and diming consumers.
